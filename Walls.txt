I finally felt like I had snapped. I went into the bathroom after being yelled at by my family. I entered the bathroom, locked it after a shower... I managed to draw blood, don't ask me how. ... After minutes of smearing it on the walls, I turned out the lights, lied down in the bath-tub and turned the water on. I lied face down in the tub my clothes now drenched and water filling my lungs. I felt this was a good send off. --

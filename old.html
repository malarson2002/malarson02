<p>Really, I had no idea until I was about 10. My mother told me that she had slept with a man who was 20 years older than she was. I felt devastated, but then, as we were casually crossing the street, she told me that she had three mis-carriages. Knowing that I could have had 3 other brothers or sisters kinda darkened me. Probably why all my lights burned out, and I keep my TV on govt. access. 'Dunno.</p>

thats cool
ive just been thinking about sad shit
and you
yknow?
like
there's something about you
that maybe i think ill never live up to my hopes and fantasies?
and that itself gets me discouraged, mad, and sad
and
i think thats why the absence id imagine some perfect friendship like how i share with my other friends
but some invisible line i cant even feel around for
i dont know why
you ruin me
and it isnt even your fault
i dont even know if its mine
not to sound all edgy and stupid but
you're so much like poison to me
i sound rude saying this but its whats on my heart
being around you breaks me down and makes me so little and useless.
confidence, drive, happiness. it's so
stupid
man
i cant even leave you yknow
because theres always something that reminds me of you
and ill keep coming back
or be dragged back by someone
of you left me calm
i totally
just
shit talked you so hard a few hours ago in a vc
and yknow
i cant even tell if i mean it
i feel right in the momoent
then i text you and
you're just the center of everything
i dont really believe in bipolar. i think its only a thing if you believe you're it yknow.
and im not
that.
i dont know what to do with myself.
yeah.
